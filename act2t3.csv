Assignment 1: Implementation of Lamport Clocks to Order Life Events
Email: angelortega@umail.ucsb.edu


Program is working and fully functional. Tested on CSIL and my own machine.
The program uses scala and sbt, which may cause some dependency issues, but I
switched to a scalac and scala native compilation for the code to build in the repository. If issues arise please email me.

Note: A warning message will arise from using a purely functional infite loop.
To break out of the program simply call the default Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-C keyboard interrupts

I have tested the sampleP[0-9].txt in the following order as well:
sampleP1.txt
sampleP2.txt
sampleP3.txt

Please note that all processes should be running before sending a socket request. I have added a delay for that reason and an attempt to connect (5 times)
If questions arise please feel free to contact me. :)
